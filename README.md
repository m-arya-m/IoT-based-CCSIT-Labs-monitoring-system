## To install an IoT-based temperature monitoring system using XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, follow these general steps:

 1. Set up the hardware by connecting the DHT11 sensor to the NODEMCU ESP8266.
 2. Install XAMPP for a local server and Visual Studio Code for development.
 3. Configure a PostgreSQL database for storing temperature data.
 4. Write and upload the code to the NODEMCU using Arduino IDE.
 5. Start the XAMPP server and access the application via a web browser for monitoring.


## Installation Instructions

Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   Use Git to clone the repository containing the project files.
2. Download XAMPP:
   Visit the official XAMPP website and download the installer for your operating system.
   Follow the installation instructions to set up the local server environment.
   
3. Download Visual Studio Code:
   Go to the Visual Studio Code website and download the installer.
   Install Visual Studio Code by following the setup instructions.
   
4. Set up the environment:
   Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
   Create a new database in PostgreSQL for the project.
   
5. Configure the project:
   Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
   Modify configuration files as necessary to connect to the database and set up any required environment variables.
   
6. Upload code to NODEMCU:
   Use the Arduino IDE to write and upload the code to the NODEMCU ESP8266.
   Ensure the code includes the necessary libraries for the DHT11 sensor and Wi-Fi connectivity.
